+ How to use it.
+ It's limitations.

**Useful Links**  

+ [Unity Manual - Remote 4](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote4.html)

### Review & Improvements ###

+ Read music volume on load, improve Win & Lose.
+ Catch 1st order error with **autoLoadLevelAfter().**
+ Alternative fade without coding (thank Ryan).
+ Save our scene of sprites & prefab everything.
+ Our current project state is attached.

### Moving Attackers From Script ###

+ Create an Attacker.cs component.
+ Why this component model is useful.
+ Tune our animation to avoid “moon walking”.

### Collision Matrix In Script ###

+ Using **OnTriggerEnter2D (Collider2D collider).**
+ Why we are using triggers not physics.
+ Why we won't use the collision matrix this time.
+ Adding appropriate colliders to all objects.

### Using Animation Events ###

+ The “what” and “why” of animation events.
+ What methods can be called, and what can't.
+ Modify Attacker.cs to accept speed events.
+ Get animation transitions working for all attackers.
+ Add “wishful” StrikeCurrentTarget() method.

### Components “vs” Inheritance ###

+ The different approaches to abstraction.
+ The benefits of a component model.
+ Get **StrikeCurrentTarget()** working.

### Using A Health Component ###

+ Why a separate component makes sense.
+ Create & attach **Health.cs** component.
+ Test destruction, and initial play tuning.

### Animating Defenders & Projectiles ###

+ Three approaches to 2D projectile animation.
+ Separate defenders from their projectiles.
+ Animate projectile using script **and** animator.
+ Fix-up defender animation states.

### Animator Firing Projectiles ###

+ Why fire by animation events.
+ Create **Shooter.cs** for shooting defenders.
+ Create **FireGun()** method in Shooter class.
+ Attach a gun gameObject to spawn projectiles.
+ Arrange for animator to fire projectiles.

### Separate Attack & Fire States ###

+ Why our Gnome fires too fast.
+ Possible solutions to this type of issue.
+ Why we choose to create a “fire” state.
+ Fine-tune projectile size & spawn position.

### Handling Projectile Damage ###

+ Make projectiles damage **Attacker** with **Health**.
+ Setup a play space, and start tuning.
+ Tweak damage and health levels.
+ We'll play tune again later.

### “Tower” Selector Buttons ###

+ Setting up buttons for defender (tower) selection.
+ Initially they just toggle sprite colour.
+ Setup **DefenderSelector.selectedDefender** static
+ Test that static is set at start, and on button press.

### Creating When Needed ###

+ The problem with the Projectiles placeholder.
+ Useful blog article on best practices\*
+ A pattern for checking and creating.

+ \* [Blog - Unity3D Best Practices](http://www.glenstevens.ca/unity3d-best-practices/)

### Spawn Defenders To Grid ###

+ Ensure existing defenders' colliders mask square.
+ Calculate the world-units position of a click.
+ Calculate the nearest play-space grid centre.
+ Spawn the currently selected defender there.

### Enemy Spawning & Flow ###

+ Place enemy spawners.
+ Decide how spawning is controlled.
+ A word about the Flow Channel\*
+ Write script(s) to control spawning.

**Useful Links**  

+ \* [Game Theory Applied: The Flow Channel](http://indiedevstories.com/2011/08/10/game-theory-applied-the-flow-channel/)

### Shooters Detect Attackers ###

+ Find a way of defenders detecting attackers.
+ Only shoot at attackers if ahead in lane.
+ Modify **Shooter.cs** to make this work.
+ Test that defender enter and leave “attack” state.

### Using Stars As Currency ###

+ Add a sun scoreboard to the game space.
+ Star Trophy animation calls script to add sun.
+ Write **StarDisplay.cs** class to update scoreboard.
+ Write **defender.AddStars(int amount)** method.
+ Wire these scripts together.

### Spending Star Currency ###

+ Assign a star cost to every defender.
+ Prevent placement until you can afford it.
+ Spend stars when defenders are placed.
+ Use an **enum**eration to pass meaning.
+ Rough play tuning to create a challenge.

### Handle Lose Condition ###

+ Remove lose test button.
+ Create a lose collider.
+ Setup lose triggering & transition.
+ Improve lose screen.

### UI Slider Level Timer ###

+ Create a UI slider to visually show level progress.
+ Make the slider to “count down” to level end.
+ When time runs out…
+ Show “You Survived” text, and play a sound.
+ Auto-load next level.

### Review & Tidy Up ###

+ Tidy **Spawner.cs > isTimeToSpawn()**
+ Adjust colliders so attackers hit defenders.
+ Fix the gravestone animation transitions.
+ Creates prefabs of our work.

### Play Testing & Tuning ###

+ Display the defender cost on buttons.
+ Tweak the spawn frequency of attackers.
+ Adjust the health of attackers & defenders.
+ Choose amount of damage for projectiles.
+ Play and make sure it's a challenge.

### Installing Android Studio ###

+ Downloading & installing Android Studio.
+ How to solve common issues.

+ [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

### Building To Android ###

+ Setting up Build Settings for Android.
+ Deploying to Android device\*
+ Play testing on the device.

_\* You'll need a device connected with a USB cable._

### Build To iOS Simulator ###

+ Setup Build Settings in Unity.
+ Build to iOS simulator (Mac “needed”).
+ To build to physical device you “need” a dev kit.
+ Briefly play-test, and note improvements.
+ Share your creation with the world.

### User Testing Tweaks ###

+ Simplify by removing **SetStartVolume.cs**\*
+ Destroy tagged game objects on Win condition.
+ … this also solves the “You Win” issue.
+ Add a simple STOP button to game.

_\* Thanks to Marko for suggesting this._
